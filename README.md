## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

I learnt more about how to use Semantaic HTML5 elements instead of relying solely on div to place elements
I also learnt more about css3 pseudo classes. I used them alot in my code for this project, I didn't use the normal class and id attributes.

```css
article:nth-of-type(1) {
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
}

article:nth-of-type(2) {
    opacity: 0.7;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}

section:nth-of-type(1), article {
    padding: 45px 40px 40px 40px;
}

```
